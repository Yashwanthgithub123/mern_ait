class is a user defined data type
interview questions:
why the constructor in java is static abstract 
why in the main we have to declare the public static void main
object is an encapsulated  group of data  which are closely related to each other
CLASS : that gives a clear  boundary
void setMarks(int marks) {
 this.marks = marks(this is the function argument);
 //this.marks makes it as the object variable
 }
 populateMarks(List Students <Student> ,int marks[]) {
 int i = 0;
 for(student : Students) {
 student.setMarks(marks[i]);
 i++;
 }
 }
